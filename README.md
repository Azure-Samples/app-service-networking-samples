### Installation

The below walk-through contains the steps for creating a resource group in Azure and the steps needed to set up your deployment secret in your GitHub repository. 
You will need the latest version of the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed to execute these steps.

1. Define environment variables.

```bash
RESOURCE_GROUP='appsvcnetworkingdemo'

```azurecli
az login
az account list -o table
az account set <your-subscription-id>
```

1. Create a resource group for all necessary resources.

```azurecli
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
```

1. Copy the resource group ID which is outputted in the previous step to a new environment variable.

```azurecli
RESOURCE_GROUP_ID=<resource group ID from previous output>
```

1. Create a service principal and give it access to the resource group.

```azure cli
az ad sp create-for-rbac \
  --name AppServiceNetworkingDemo \
  --role Contributor \
  --scopes $RESOURCE_GROUP_ID \
  --sdk-auth
```
